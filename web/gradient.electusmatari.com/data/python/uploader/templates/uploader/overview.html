<h1>Gradient Data Uploader</h1>

<p>The Gradient Data Uploader is a client program that monitors your
EVE client's cache files for interesting game data, and uploads this
data to the server. This information includes for example the market
orders you are currently viewing. The client is fully customizeable so
you have full control over which information you share and which you
don't.</p>

<p>And yes&mdash;this is absolutely legal according to CCP.</p>

<h2>Uploading Data in 3 Simple Steps</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Install the Uploader</h3>

<p>Download the installer and execute it. It will automatically
install itself on your computer.</p>

<form method="get" action="/uploader/files/gdu.exe">
<input type="submit" value="Download the Installer" />
</form>

<h3>Step 2: Get Your Authentication Token</h3>

<p>To minimize abuse, we need to associate every upload with your
forum account. To allow GDU to identify the uploads as coming from
you, it needs to know an <em>authentication token.</em> Simply copy it
into the text field of the uploader.</p>

{% if auth_token %}
<p>Your authentication token is:</p>

<pre>{{auth_token}}</pre>

<p>Should you accidentally share your authentication token with a
third party, don't worry, you can easily change it.</p>

<form method="get" action="/uploader/token/">
<input type="submit" value="Change Your Authentication Token" />
</form>
{% else %}
<form method="get" action="/uploader/token/">
<input type="submit" value="Get Your Authentication Token" />
</form>
{% endif %}

<h3>Step 3: Upload Away!</h3>

<p>Once the uploader is configured with your authentication token and
running, you just play the game - it will do its work in the
background. You can even configure it to <b>auto-start</b> in the
configuration panel, so you don't even have to remember to start it
before you play EVE. It should not interfere with other games or
programs in any way.</p>

<p>If you would like to spend some dedicated time uploading data, you
can visit our auto-upload page with the In-Game Browser. The page will
use the In-Game Browser's JavaScript methods to open market windows
etc. to check for information. And if you "trust" the auto-uploader
page with your In-Game Browser, it will be able to dedicatedly figure
out what it needs to see.</p>

{% if isigb %}
<form method="get" action="/uploader/auto/">
<input type="submit" value="Upload Suggestions" />
</form>
{% else %}
<p>Copy and open in your In-Game Browser:<br />
